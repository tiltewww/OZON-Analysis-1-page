# OZON-Analysis-1-page


I did a little analysis of OZON to find Electric Toothbrushes and got a good result. 
The project is incomplete, 1/3 of the analysis has been implemented and will be updated in the future


The graph shows the price ratio of Toothbrushes on the first page:
- Low Price (<$11)
- Average Price ($11 > but, <$30)
- High Price (>$30)

The code also counts:
- The Maximum Price
- The Minimum Price
- The Average Price
